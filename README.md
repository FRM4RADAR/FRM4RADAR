# FRM4RADAR
A small repository for the development of a common codebase for radar data processing and visualization in python.


# Summary
So far code uploaded to this repository was made for :
- netCDF4 file handling
- hourly to daily conversions
- visualization of the data
- filtering of noise 

# Exmaple of data processing
